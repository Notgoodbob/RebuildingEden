# RebuildingEden
Rebuilding Eden is a terminal-only text-based survival game made in Python. It takes place shortly after a post-apocalyptic event.



Rebuilding Eden is a passion project by me. It is inspired by multiple already-existing games like it, and I've spent a good amount of time on it.

This is currently not an executable, and will remain that way until the game is finished. This is just an 
easy way to commit changes and mass-post my source code for playtesters.

BEFORE YOU PLAY:

1) Ensure you have the latest version of python installed on your computer. You can find a download here: {https://www.python.org/downloads/}
2) Download the latest RebuildingEden commit and drag the .py to your desktop.

HOW TO PLAY:
1) Open your terminal. 
2) Ensure your directory is in your desktop
3) Type "python3 {file name here}" to open the .py file.
4) Enjoy!
