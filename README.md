# RebuildingEden
Rebuilding Eden is a terminal-only text-based survival game made in Python. It takes place shortly after a post-apocalyptic event.

This is currently not an executable, and will remain that way until the game is finished. This is just an 
easy way to commit changes and mass-post my source code for playtesters.
