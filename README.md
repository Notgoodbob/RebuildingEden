# RebuildingEden
Rebuilding Eden is a terminal-only text-based survival game made in Python. It takes place shortly after a post-apocalyptic event.

<s> NOTE: I have paused production on this Text-based version of Rebuilding Eden. I have begun the process of converting this game into a Unity 3D game world, as I believe it to be the best way to exercise my programming abilities. Updates may still come for this version of Rebuilding Eden, but expect no new additions for a while. </s>

Rebuilding Eden is a passion project by me. It is inspired by multiple already-existing games like it, and I've spent a good amount of time on it.

This is currently not an executable, and will remain that way until the game is finished. This is just an 
easy way to commit changes and mass-post my source code for playtesters. - Some aditional framework will also need to be implemented, especially for something like PyGame, which may be what I use. More news to come.
