# RebuildingEden
Rebuilding Eden is a terminal-only text-based survival game made in Python. It takes place shortly after a post-apocalyptic event.

<s> NOTE: I have paused production on this Text-based version of Rebuilding Eden. I have begun the process of converting this game into a Unity 3D game world, as I belive it to be the best way to exercise my programming abilities. Updates may still come for this version of Rebuilding Eden, but expect no new additions for a while. <s>

After realizing I should stick to one project at a time and finish it, I have begun production on Rebuilding Eden again. Expect updates weekly / periodically.
Rebuilding Eden is a passion project by me. It is inspired by multiple already-existing games like it, and I've spent a good amount of time on it.

This is currently not an executable, and will remain that way until the game is finished. This is just an 
easy way to commit changes and mass-post my source code for playtesters.
